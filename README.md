Akeneo PIM Community Standard Edition
=====================================
Welcome to Akeneo PIM Standard Edition.

This repository contains the minimal application needed to start a new project based on Akeneo PIM.
Practically, it means Akeneo PIM is declared as a dependency and will reside in the vendor directory.

If you want to contribute to Akeneo PIM, please use the PIM Community Dev repository located at
https://github.com/akeneo/pim-community-dev

Important Note: this application is not production ready and is intending for evaluation and development purposes only!

Requirements
------------
 - PHP 5.3.3 or above
 - PHP Modules:
    - php5-curl
    - php5-gd
    - php5-intl
    - php5-mysql
 - a PHP opcode cache (Akeneo is tested mainly with APC)
 - MySQL 5.1 or above
 - Apache mod rewrite enabled

Akene PIM is based on Symfony 2, Doctrine 2 and Oro PlatformÂ [OroPlatform][3].
These dependencies will be installed automatically with [Composer][2].

Installation instructions
-------------------------
## Using Composer to create the project

This is the recommended way to install Akeneo PIM.

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    $ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

### Create a Akeneo PIM project with Composer

Due to some Oro Platform limitations, you **MUST** create your database before launching composer.

    $ mkdir pim-project
    $ php composer.phar create-project akeneo/pim-community-standard ./pim-project dev-master

Note that using the "--prefer-dist" option can speed up the installation by
looking into your local Composer cache.

### Initialize data and assets

    $ cd pim-project
    $ ./install.sh all

Note: This script can be executed several times if you need to reinit your db or redeploy your assets.
By default, this script initialize the dev environment.

Create the Apache Virtual host
------------------------------

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName akeneo-pim.local

    DocumentRoot /path/to/your/pim/installation/web/
    <Directory /path/to/your/pim/installation/web/>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
    </Directory>
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/akeneo-pim_error.log

    # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit, alert, emerg.
    LogLevel warn
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/akeneo-pim_access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```
Do not forget to change the "/path/to/your/pim/installation/web" to the full path to
the web directory inside your Akeneo PIM installation directory.

Now, you just have to add your host to hosts file `/etc/hosts`:

```
127.0.0.1 localhost akeneo-pim.local
```

Write permission for the HTTP server
------------------------------------

You must give write permission to the Apache user on the following directories:
- app/cache
- app/logs
- app/logs/batch
- app/entities
- web/bundles/jsformvalidation
- web/uploads/product

Checking your System Configuration
----------------------------------

Before starting to use your application, make sure that your system is properly
configured for a Symfony application.

Execute the `check.php` script from the command line:

    php app/check.php

If you get any warnings or recommendations, fix them before moving on.

Connect to your PIM application
-------------------------------

Go to http://akeneo-pim.local/ for production mode or http://akeneo-pim.local/app_dev.php for development mode.

You can now connect as Akeneo administrator with the following credentials:
- login: "admin"
- password "admin"


Generating a clean database
---------------------------

By default, when you install the PIM, demo data are added to the database.

If you want to get only the bare minimum data to have a clean but functionnal pim,
just switch the following config line to false in app/config/config.yml:

```
pim_demo:
    load_data: false
```

Then relaunch the install.sh script with the db option:

$ ./install.sh db
