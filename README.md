============================

Welcome to Akeneo PIM.

This document contains information on how to download, install, and start using Akeneo PIM.

Important Note: this application is not production ready and is intending for evaluation and development only!

Requirements
------------

Akeneo PIM requires PHP 5.3.3 or above and MySQL 5.1 or above.

Akene PIM is based on Symfony 2, Doctrine 2 and Oro Platform (see http://www.orocrm.com/oro-platform).
These dependencies will be installed automatically with [Composer][2].


Installation instructions
-------------------------

### Using Composer

This is the recommended way to install Akeneo PIM.

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    $ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Clone Akeneo PIM project with:

    $ git clone git@github.com:akeneo/pim-community-standard.git

Now, you can go to your pim project directory.

    $ cd pim-community-standard

Install Akeneo PIM dependencies with Composer. Note that using the "--prefer-dist" option can speed up
the installation by looking into your local Composer cache.
Don't forget to create your database before launching this script.

    $ php composer.phar install

Then initialize the application data with the provided install script:

    $ ./install.sh

Create the Apache Virtual host
------------------------------

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName akeneo-pim.local

    DocumentRoot /path/to/your/pim/installation/web/
    <Directory /path/to/your/pim/installation/web/>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
    </Directory>
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/akeneo-pim_error.log

    # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit, alert, emerg.
    LogLevel warn
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/akeneo-pim_access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```
Do not forget to change the "/path/to/your/pim/installation/web" to the full path to
the web directory contains inside your Akeneo PIM installation directory

Now, you just have to add your host to hosts file `/etc/hosts`:

```
127.0.0.1 localhost akeneo-pim.local
```

--------------------------

You must give write permission to the Apache user on the following directories:
- app/cache
- app/logs
- app/logs/batch
- app/entities
- web/bundles
- web/uploads

Checking your System Configuration
----------------------------------

Before starting to use your application, make sure that your local system is properly
configured for a Symfony application.

    php app/check.php

If you get any warnings or recommendations, fix them before moving on.
